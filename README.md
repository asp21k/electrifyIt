<h1 align="center" id="title">ElectrifyIT Dashboard</h1>

<p id="description">This project consists of a web application for generating reports based on vehicle data. The application is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies including Next.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend Node.js with Express for the backend and MongoDB for the database. The frontend is deployed on Vercel while the backend is deployed on an Azure VM. MongoDB Atlas is used for hosting the database.</p>
